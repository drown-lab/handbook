# Computing Resources

## Hardware

As resources allow, full-time lab members (graduate students, postdocs, and staff) will be issued a computer that is in line with their needs. Budget will be approximately $1k and will run Windows.

If you prefer to purchase your own machine, I strongly recommend that Windows platforms for compatibility with the rest of the lab and most mass spectrometry software. But ultimately, the choice is yours.

## Essential software

- **Microsoft Office** - Office 365 is available for all students and staff for free
- **Adobe Suite** - Available for use on both university-owned and personal computers
- **Microsoft Teams** - Primary means of quick communication
- **Reference Management Software** - We predominantly use Paperpile due to its integration with Google Docs and Word. Warning: reference managers make mistakes when importing. Before submitting papers, grants, or fellowships, carefully proofread citations.

- **ChemDraw** - Draw professional chemical structures, free for chemistry students

## Mass Spectrometry Software

### General

- **FreeStyle** - Views and analyzes RAW files from Thermo mass spectrometers
- **QualBrowser** - Older 32-bit viewer of RAW files
- [**mMass**](http://www.mmass.org/) - Simple viewer of mzML files. (free)
- [**RawMeat**](https://proteomicsresource.washington.edu/protocols06/) - Basic info about RAW files. (free)
- [**ProteoWizard**](https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/) - Collection of tools used by other software packages. MSConvert can convert data files. (free)

### Top-down Mass Spectrometry

- [**ProSight Lite**](http://prosightlite.northwestern.edu/) - Scores matching fragmentation data. (free)
- [**TDportal**](https://portal.nrtdp.northwestern.edu/) - Online search engine hosted by NRTDP at Northwestern University. Ask Bryon about access. (free)
- [**TDvalidator**](https://www.proteinaceous.net/tdvalidator) - Scores matching fragmentation data with an isotope fitter (licensed)
- [**UniDec**](https://github.com/michaelmarty/UniDec) - Deconvolution software that works well for charge-resolved MS1 data (free)
- [**STORIboard**](https://www.proteinaceous.net/storiboard) - Processes I2MS data (free)
- [**TDviewer**](http://tdviewer2.northwestern.edu/) - View results from TDportal or ProSight PD (free)
- [**MASH Explorer**](https://labs.wisc.edu/gelab/software.html) - GUI for several top-down analysis packages. (free)
- [**TopPIC**](https://www.toppic.org/software/toppic/index.html) - Deconvolution and search algorithms. (free)

### Bottom-up Mass Spectrometry

- **MaxQuant**
- **Skyline**
- **FragPipe**

## Additional Software

- [**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - A medium-weight text editor with integrations with Github and runtimes.
- [**R Studio**](https://www.rstudio.com/) - An R-specific IDE with excellent notebook support. (free)

## Online Resources

- **Box**
- [**Github**](https://github.com/drown-lab) - we host protocols and analysis workflows on Github
  - Create an account
  - Post on Teams asking someone to add you to the lab organization
- **Data Depot** - Secure, scalable, and redundant storage through Purdue RCAC. This is where all raw experimental data should go.
- **Password Manager** - You are going to make a lot of accounts for work. Reusing passwords is a security risk, so I recommend using one of many out there (LastPass, BitWarden, Zoho).
