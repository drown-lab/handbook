# Welcome

You've joined the Drown Laboratory at Purdue University; welcome to the team! We're a growing team of scientists at different stages in our training (undergrads, grad, and PhDs). This is a living document that is intended to help everyone work towards individual and collective goals safely and ethically. This document borrows from other great research groups with well-documented policies: [Parkinson Lab](https://www.parkinsonlaboratory.com/), [Lowe-Power Lab](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/lab_handbook), and [Aly Lab](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual). This document is licensed under [Creative Commons 4.0](LICENSE). If you are interested in wiriting your own lab manual, please feel free to borrow from this one (and cite). If you are a member of the Drown Lab, consider suggesting changes or additions by submitting a pull request. If you don't have specific changes to suggest but have a question or concern, talk to Bryon directly or create an Issue.

When you join this lab, you're expected to read this manual. You are also highly encouraged to read this if you are considering joining the lab.

Training is designed to prepare you for a successful career in science or science-related fields. Getting a good job is competitive, and requires that you have a track record of research. This includes letters of reference, presentations, publications, and teaching. It also requires a lot of motivation and being a good lab citizen. This document attempts to outline things that will help you maximize your time here.

## Mission

We seek to train the next generation of scientists by performing excellent research that impacts fundamental understanding and future clinical outcomes. This overall objective is achieved through highly interdisciplinary work focused on answering challenging questions we face in human disease. Answering difficult questions often requires new methodologies or creative adaptations of exisiting approaches.
