# General Policies

## Productivity

**Academic flexibility is earned by academic productivity.**

Productivity is similar to a bacterial growth curve. There is a lag phase where you will be building the pieces that you need to be productive. This is the learning phase. During the learning phase, you should balance lab work with conceptual work (reading papers, writing proposals).

After some experience, you will enter the growth phase & your productivity is more obvious. During this phase, you will know which experiments can be multi-tasked. You should be able to start multiple experiments per week (and keep on track with data analysis). Continue to spend some time preparing to grow in new directions.

## Hours

In general, a successful scientific career, especially one that includes research, requires  minimally 50 hours a week of work. How this time is organized throughout the week can vary depending on the type of research being done. Therefore, the most important thing is that you are consistently moving your research project forward. For a instrumentation-centric project, continuous time working on an instrument is beneficial. Organize your time so you will be able to work uninterrupted or your day may go longer than expected. When you don't have instrument time, still use your time effectively (analyze data, craft figures, read literature, plan your next experiment). For biology- or synthesis-centric projects, consistency is key. Experiments can run for a long time, so work on developing the skill of overlapping experiments. Sometimes cells don't work on your schedule so a few minutes in the lab on Sunday to setup for the next week can make a world of difference.

To foster intra-lab interactions, try to be in lab during peak hours (assuming no other obligations) - .e.g 11am - 4pm.

Respect your labmates work-life balance. While we're all free to send messages in the evenings/weekends, we are under no obligation to respond to them unless there is a rare emergency or deadline. If these crunch times can be anticipated, I will try to coordinate this in advance with you. Some people get stressed out by seeing unread messages on digital devices. If that describes you, let Bryon know and he will do his best to schedule messages during normal business hours. Teams mobile also has the ability to schedule quiet hours (and days) during which notifications are muted.

## Time Off

Vacation is very important and I expect that you will use your given vacation time (~2 weeks/year plus holidays). Except in the case where you skip some vacation the prior year so you can take an extra week (for example, travel overseas), it can slow down your research if you exceed 2 weeks plus holidays per year. You also get up to 10 days of sick leave. If you are sick, STAY HOME and email me to let me know that you will not be in. See the Grad School’s [Grad Staff Employment Manual](https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/documents/gpo/graduate-student-employment-manual.pdf) and HR's [Grad Student Staff Benefits S-3 page](https://www.purdue.edu/policies/human-resources/s3.html) for more details.

Please inform Bryon when you plan to take vacation time off. You can generally expect time off to be approved, but knowing when people are not accessible is important when planning around manuscript and grant submissions.

## Shared Research Space

In Bindley Bioscience Center, our lab and office spaces overlap with other research groups. Sometimes the lines dividing what is our, what is shared, and what is not freely accessible to us become blurred. Equipment labelled "Drown Lab", "Drown Research Group", "Drown", or "DRG" were purchased with funds obtained for our group. New equipment should be labelled in this manner. There are several instruments/equipment owned by other research groups that we frequently use. Seek out permission and training from those other groups as a courtesy to them and so they can track usage.

## Deadlines

Give Bryon at least 1 week's notice to do something with a hard deadline that doesn't require much time (e.g. reading/commenting on conference abstracts, filling out paperwork, etc).

Give Bryon at least two weeks' notice (preferably more) to do something with a hard deadline that requires a moderate amount of time, especially if it's a complex task that will benefit from Bryon drafting it and revising it later with fresh eyes (e.g. a letter of recommendation).

If you want feedback on research proposals/statements, teaching statements, or other work that requires multiple back-and-forth interactions between you and Bryon before a hard deadline, give him as much time as you can; at the very least two weeks.

When communicating important hard deadlines with Bryon, send an organized email that uses formatting (judicious bolding) to convey key points: (1) Deadline, (2) What is needed from Bryon, (3) Key information that Bryon needs to do the job well. Consider this practice for any form of professional communication -- grantsmanship, managing a team, managing your manager. It's a transferable skill that will take you far in your career.

### Recommendation Letters

Please use the following form to request letters of recommendation from Bryon.

- [Undergrad studnt who took Bryon's course](https://forms.gle/rX1zW5uviBJNXm767)
- Undergrad who worked in Drown Lab (TODO)
- Graduate student (TODO)

Strong letters of recommendation are specific and fact-based. The form above will help you remind Bryon of specific times when you exhibited an important skill or competency. After you fill out the form, let Bryon know that you requested a Rec letter.

Bryon will ask postdoc/graduate mentors to co-write letters of recommendation for undergraduate researchers with whom the supervise. This is professional training for the mentor and will help the letter be stronger and detailed.

## Scientific Integrity

### Research (Mis)conduct

The lab, and Purdue University, is committed to ensuring research integrity, and we take a hard line on research misconduct. We will not tolerate fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism. Read Purdue’s policies on the conduct of research carefully (main page here, institutional policy here, more information here).

A big problem is why people feel the need to engage in misconduct in the first place, and that’s a discussion that we can have. If you are feeling pressured to succeed (publish a lot, publish in high impact journals), you should reach out to Bryon and we can talk about it – but this pressure is something we all face and is never an excuse to fabricate, falsify, or plagiarize. Also, think about the goal of science and why you are here: you’re here to arrive at the truth, to get as close as we can to facts about the brain and behavior. Not only is research misconduct doing you a disservice.

### Research Reproducibility

If you gave someone else your raw data, they should be able to reproduce your results exactly. This is critical, because if they can’t reproduce your results, it suggests that one (or both) of you has made errors in the analysis, and the results can’t be trusted. Reproducible research is an essential part of science, and an expectation for all projects in the lab.

For results to be reproducible, the analysis pipeline must be organized and well documented. To meet these goals, you should take extensive notes on each step of your analysis pipeline. This means writing down how you did things every step of the way (and the order that you did things), from any pre-processing of the data, to running models, to statistical tests. It’s also worth mentioning that you should take detailed notes on your experimental design as well. Finally, it is highly encouraged that you use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of protocols and code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing protocols/code with others. The lab’s GitHub organization is [drown-lab](https://github.com/drown-lab).

Reproducibility is related to replicability, which refers to whether your results can be obtained again with a different data set. That is, if someone ran your study again (with a different group of samples), do they get the same results? If someone ran a conceptually similar study, do they get the same results? Science grows and builds on replicable results – one-off findings don’t mean anything. Our goal is to produce research that is both reproducible and replicable.
