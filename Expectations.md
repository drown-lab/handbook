# Expectations and Responsibilities

## Everyone

Science is hard. Each member of the Drown Lab is responsible for contributing to our community of trainees in a postive and productive manner. We want to make sure everyone experiences an engaging, hostility-free, challenging, and rewarding professional lab environment.

In general, I expect you to:

- Learn how to **plan**, **design**, and **conduct** high quality scientific research
- Keep an up-to-date, reasonably organized digital lab notebook.
- Be **honest**, **ethical**, and **enthusiastic**
- Learn how to present and document your scientific findings
- Be *engaged* within the research group and with outside colleagues
- Treat your lab mates, lab funds, equipment, and your time with *respect*
- Take advantage of professional development opportunities
- Celebrate the successes of your lab mates and peers
- Work hard – *don’t give up*!
- *Be kind.* We have a lot of freedom in academia, and I want our lab to be known for using that freedom to be kind.  Make sure that your kindness is **Radically Candid** and not Ruinously Empathetic.
- Maintain an orderly lab space
- Take care of yourself mentally and physically.

### ⮞ **You will take ownership over your training experience**

✔ **Acknowledge that you have the primary responsibility for the successful completion of your projects and degree/fellowship.** You should maintain a high level of professionalism, self-motivation, engagement, scientific curiosity, and ethical standards.

✔ **Ensure that you meet regularly with me and provide me with updates on the progress and results of your activities and experiments.**

✔ **Be knowledgeable of the policies, deadlines, and requirements of the program and the university.** Comply with all institutional policies, including academic program milestones, laboratory practices, and rules related to lab safety. PhD students are expected to meet with their thesis committee once per year. It is *your responsibility* to plan and coordinate these meetings.

✔ **Actively cultivate your professional development.** Purdue University has resources in place to support professional development for students and postdocs. It is important to take advantage of these resources, since becoming a successful scientist involves more than just doing academic research. Aim to attend a weekly seminar. Attendance at conferences and workshops will also provide professional development opportunities. If you find a training opportunity related to particular skill, share it with me, and we will try to make it happen.

✔ **Develop your writing and presentation skills.**  As you start to make progress, begin outlining a paper’s figures and drafting the text, especially the *Methods*. Be prepared to go through rounds of revisions before submitting an abstract, poster, or paper. Although the availability of travel funds will vary, I encourage everyone to attend at least one conference per year (although it is required that you present a poster or give a talk). Conference abstracts need to be approved by me prior to submission, and we should work on your talk or poster together before it is finalized.  Take full advantage of local opportunities to present your research, including local seminar series, etc.

✔ **Schedule practice talks.**  Schedule practice talks with the lab so that you can get feedback on a talk before you give it. You should book a room, put the time on the lab calendar, and ask folks on Teams to attend. (You should plan for 2x the talk length for the practice talk). For the practice talk, be ready to start at the scheduled time. Bring print-outs of the slides so that everyone can write down notes. Before you do the practice talk, you should have rehearsed enough that you know what you want to say for most slides.

✔ **Build your mentoring team.** Everyone needs many mentors with diverse perspectives throughout their career. Once you recognize my strengths and deficiencies as a mentor, seek out additional formal and informal mentors to help you achieve your goals. Seek out diverse mentors: peer mentors, mentors with a shared background, mentors inside & outside of academia. Also, seek out mentees as well. We can grow both by mentoring and being mentored.

## Principle Investigator

What you should expect from me (Bryon)

✔ **I will set the scientific trajectory for the lab and provide the means to pursue those directions.**  This will include helping you to find a research topic, writing grants to fund the research, and seeking out collaborators for our work and to further your opportunities. I encourage you to bring new ideas to the lab, but we need to make sure there will be funding for your salary and reagents.

✔ **I will have high expectations of you**. Everyone comes into lab with a unique background and a unique combination of skills and expertise. The commonality is that we all have room to grow our skills and expertise while pushing scientific knowledge forward. You will guide your own growth. Sometimes this growth will be easy and quick. Other times it will be challenging and hard-earned.

✔ **I will be available for regular meeting and informal conversations.** The format of these will change based on my availability and my perception of what the lab needs. For the first several months, we will meet weekly with a research update agenda that you prepare. As you gain indepdendence, we will transition to biweekly, and then "when you have useful content for a meeting".

✔ **I will provide timely feedback** on your project ideas, conference posters, talks, manuscripts, data, and grants. Provide me with 1 week to give you feedback on your work.

✔ **I am committed to mentoring you now and in the future.**  I am committed to your education and training while in my lab, and to advising and guiding your career development. I will support your career development by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, and writing recommendation letters for you. I will help you prepare for the next step of your career, whether it's grad school, a post-doc, a faculty job, or a job outside of academia.

✔ **I will discuss data ownership and authorship policies regarding papers with you.**  These can create unnecessary conflict within the lab and among collaborators. It is important that we communicate openly and regularly about them. Do not hesitate to voice concerns when you have them.

✔ **I will encourage you to attend scientific/professional meetings.**  I will not be able to cover all requests but you can generally expect to attend at least one major domestic conference per year, when you have material to present. Securing outside funding (e.g. a fellowship or travel award) will likely enable you to attend additional meetings, especially international meetings. I will work together with you to strengthen your presentation skills.

✔ **I will strive to be supportive, equitable, accessible, and respectful.**  I will try my best to understand your unique situation and mentor you accordingly.  I am mindful that each trainee comes from a different background and has different professional goals. It will help if you keep me in formed about your experiences.

## Graduate Students

In addition to the general expectations above, you are expected to

- Generally maintain a positive, solution-oriented attitude
- Cultivate your curiosity about the work you do and think creatively
- Actively participate in all laboratory group functions
- Be responsible for your own productivity and schedule, and maintain flexibility in your schedule during emergencies and crunch times.
  - Prioritize time for research.  Coursework and TAing are important, but ultimately your research gets you your PhD and prepares you for the next stage of your career.  
- Develop your dissertation research with my input. Your dissertation should have at least 2 substantial products (papers) that address an important scientific question.  Much of the work must be completed independently (even if it is collaborative), but others in the lab are available to help you.
- Identify portions of your research that can be delegated to undergraduate researchers on a mentored research projects. I (Bryon) will help you recruit motivated undergraduates to work with you.
- Apply for fellowships/grants at every eligible opportunity (NSF GRFP, NIH, travel awards for every conference, etc). Even if you don't get funded, grant writing provides you motivation to formalize your research ideas and solicit feedback.
- Grow to be the expert in your domain.  Challenge me (Bryon) when I am wrong.
- Contribute to lab chores.  Bryon will strive to divide duties equitably.
- Represent the lab with pride and integrity, and show respect for others.  You are now an ambassador for the lab as well as a member.  Our reputation will be partially formed by how you interact with other colleagues, staff, and others.

## Undergraduate Students

As an undergraduate in the Drown lab, your first priority is school.  We are happy to have you and excited for your to progress in your experimental skills, but your degree responsibilities come first.  The lab supports your efforts to succeed scholastically at Purdue University, and working in the lab should enhance those efforts, not detract from them.  If you can be successful in school AND have time to work in the lab, while you are here you are expected to:

- Generally maintain a positive, solution-oriented attitude
- Ask questions. Cultivate your curiosity about what you're working on, why you're being taught something, how what you're doing fits into the larger picture, and make sure you've cleared up any confusion about a task *before* beginning.
- Maintain and treat all lab equipment with care
- Actively participate in whatever laboratory group functions you can attend.
- Adhere to the agreed upon schedule of work hours, and be available and willing to work beyond it in emergencies except,
  - If scheduling conflicts arise. In this case, be proactive and communicate effectively with me and other depending on you.
- Remain focused an task-oriented while working (e.g. avoid cell-phones, social media, and other distractions)
- Maintain a legible, organized, and fully-updated lab notebook in OneNote.
- Look for and submit fellowship/scholarship applications to receive funding.
- Include Bryon and other mentors on all communications regarding lab research (yours and others'). Basic research can be a competitive environment, so we ask that you are thoughtful about what details you share about our work.  If you are unsure of what you can share and with whom, please ask your mentor or Bryon.
- Represent the lab with pride and integrity, and show respect for others.  You are now an ambassador for the lab as well as a member.  Our reputation will be partially formed by how you interact with other colleauges.
- Contribute to lab chores.
- Have fun and get excited about contributing to new discoveries about life!

## Authorship Guidelines

The trainee that contributes the most to a project can expect to be the first author of published work, and Bryon will typically be the last author. Students and postdocs who help over the course of the project may be added to the author list depending on their contributions, and their placement will be discussed with all other authors. If a trainee takes on a project but subsequently hands it off to someone else, they likely will lose first authorship to the person they pass it on to, unless co-first-authorship is appropriate.

If you leave the lab with unpublished work, you should talk to Bryon about whether you plan to continue to work with him to write it up and manage experiments needed for revision after leaving, or if the final project write-up and revisions should be reassigned to another lab member. In this case, we will revisit authorship questions to determine whether you will retain first authorship, or if the lab member who completes the publication will become first author. If the unit requires significantly more labwork to confirm / support the results, then first-authorship might be passed to a current lab member. Authorship will depend on how much more needs to be done to get the research into a publishable form.
