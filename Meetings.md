# Meetings

## Weekly Group Meetings

The group meets weekly on Mondays at 5pm in BRWN 1152.

Weekly lab meetings (~1.5 hours each) are meant to be a forum for trainees to present project ideas and/or data to get feedback from the rest of the group. Projects at any level of completion (or even not yet started!) can benefit from being presented. These lab meetings can also be used to talk about methods, statistical analyses, new papers, and career development. For paper discussions, everyone must come to lab meeting having read the paper and prepared with comments and questions to contribute. Some weeks we may explore a particular issue and have people read different papers – in that case, come to lab meeting having read your paper and be prepared to summarize it for the group.

Each trainee (RA, students, post-docs) is expected to present at least once every semester. These meetings are informal, and you can do what you wish with your slot – just be prepared to contribute something substantive. Lab members are also expected to attend every meeting (obviously, illnesses, doctor appointments, family issues, etc. are a valid reason for missing a meeting). Undergraduate students are encouraged to attend as often as possible (assuming it fits in their course schedule).

The first 10 minutes of group meeting is reserved for discussing any logistical challenges that would benefit from group-wide attention. Examples include lingering instrument issues, scheduling mass spec time, and coordinating care of cultures when out of town.

## Subgroup Meetings

We also have subgroup meetings every other week that require progress reports from all trainees. This report should summarize the work that you’ve done over the past week, any and all results, and your plans for the upcoming week. If you’ve generated assay data (Excel, Prism, etc files), these should be included in the email. The format of this report is up to you. Popular options are an outline in Word, PowerPoint slides, or ChemDraw Files. Your progress report is due at least 3 hours before we meet and must be saved in your Box folder in a subfolder named subgroups. You may also email it to me but this is not a requirement. Subgroups are not necessarily long meetings. They are a good time to troubleshoot and plan out experiments, discuss results, and address any concerns or questions.
